# phpBB Extension â€” Antibot 42

[Topic on phpbbguru.net](https://www.phpbbguru.net/community/viewtopic.php?t=49868)

This phpBB extension completely eliminates spam on phpBB forums posted by any kind of spambots, using a set of know-hows. It operates completely invisibly to normal users, without captchas or other methods that might annoy them. Source code is partially obfuscated because the spambot creators also read GitHub :)
